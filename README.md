🎵 SQL PROJECT: Painting Dataset Analysis

🔍 Project Overview:
In this project, I delved into a dataset consisting of eight tables to extract meaningful insights using SQL queries. From identifying paintings not displayed in museums to uncovering the most and least popular painting styles, each question provided a unique challenge, allowing me to demonstrate my SQL skills across different difficulty levels.

🔧 Skills Covered:
=> SQL Fundamentals: Basic querying, filtering, and sorting of data.
=> Data Analysis: Aggregating and summarizing data to derive actionable insights.
=> Joins and Relationships: Utilizing various types of joins to connect tables and retrieve relevant information.
=> Subqueries and CTEs: Leveraging subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for complex data manipulation.
=> Advanced Analytics: Implementing window functions and ranking operations for advanced analysis.
=> Data Cleaning: Performing data cleaning tasks such as removing duplicate entries and handling invalid entries.
=> Data Transformation: Modifying data types while querying to ensure compatibility and consistency across tables.
=> Data Loading: Utilizing Python scripts to load CSV files into PostgreSQL, ensuring efficient data management and integration.

The complete SQL queries, solutions, and the Python script used for loading CSV files into my PostgreSQL database can be found in this repository. Feel free to explore the project code and datasets to gain insights into the world of art through data analysis.
